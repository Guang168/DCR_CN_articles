# {WIP}How to navigate Decred Project

## Purpose 
The purpose of this article is to help people who are new and interested to participate more in Decred. Many are still not familiar with how decentralized project works and find it difficult to not have a "customer service personnal" or "community manager" like many ICO projects have to provide clear guidance and answer questions about the project. This is not a directory of all available information. The guide aims to provide good resources to make the discovery journey smooth and give a headstart. 

## Guide 

### I like to know more about Decred 
While [website](https://www.decred.org/) and [documentation](https://docs.decred.org/) will answer most questions, [Company zero blog](https://blog.companyzero.com/) gives some contexts on why Decred exists. [Decred blog](https://blog.decred.org/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/decred) also hosts a good amount of articles with indepth discussions and latest updates of the project. 
 
### I need help 

1. Documentation covers some basic setup tutorials and some troubleshooting with common errors
2. Chat with people on communication channels to see if others could offer help
3. Devs on support channel are always willing to help and provide support. Just ask politely and there is no need to ask for permission to ask. 
 
### I like to contribute

1. Read blog posts on [how to be Decred Contractor](https://medium.com/decred/how-to-get-hired-as-a-decred-contractor-e1435842df10) and [how to join decred development team](https://medium.com/@NoahPierau/how-to-join-the-decred-development-team-ad2475d8d99c) if you are a developer
2. Join the community and participate in discussions 
3. Identify areas you could contribute 
4. Communicate in the relevant channels

## Community and communication channels
